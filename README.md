## Getting started with analyzing beta-galactosidase assays.

This repo provides code and best practices for Stoebel Lab members to analyze their own beta-gal experiments.

The code is written for the analysis of experiments where we are analyzing the LacZ expression as a function of RpoS level.

To use this code, please **fork** this repo, then give Dan administrator access.

If you need help getting RStudio and GitHub working together, http://happygitwithr.com/ is a great resource.
